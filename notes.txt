systemctl enable hostapd
systemctl enable dnsmasq
/etc/systemd/network/wlan0.network {exists}

To disable AP on boot: 
WARNING: Without a dhcp server to connect the pi to, this will make the pi unnaccessible
systemctl disable hostapd
systemctl disable dnsmasq
mv /etc/systemd/network/wlan0.network /path/to/somewhere/else
